    <h2><u>ANDHRA UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING</u></h2>
    <br>
    <p> 
        Andhra University is not just one of the oldest educational institutions in the country, but is also the first to be conceived as a residential and teaching-cum-affiliating University, mainly devoted to post-graduate teaching and research. <br> <br>
The people of the State have an emotional attachment to the institution, since it came into being after a prolonged and collective struggle of the Telugu elite for a University in the educationally backward northern Circars and Ceded districts of the erstwhile Madras Presidency. <br> <br>
Andhra University was constituted in the year 1926 by the Madras Act of 1926. The 94-year-old institution is fortunate to have Sir C.R. Reddy as its founder Vice-Chancellor, as the steps taken by this visionary proved to be fruitful in the long run. <br> <br>
There are 365 affiliated colleges spread across five districts under the territorial jurisdiction of Andhra University. The enrolment in Affiliated Colleges is about one Lakh. <br><br>
The Department of Computer Science and Systems Engineering was given the status of a separate department in 1983, after bifurcation of the Electrical Engineering department. Since inception, it has grown in stature to be ranked amongst one of the best in the country. <br><br>
